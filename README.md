## SMS Authentication (Twilio API) ##
**Since we will use the free version without paying, the transactions we make will only take place on our own phone number.
You have to pay a certain fee to remove this restriction.**

- The error you will get when you send an sms to a phone number other than your own phone will be:
  * Unable to create record: The number  is unverified. Trial accounts cannot send messages to unverified numbers; verify  at _twilio.com/user/account/phone-numbers/verified_, or purchase a Twilio number to send messages to unverified numbers.

- If the written code is correct, a new window appears. And since it checks this every second,
a new window does not open when it is written incorrectly or incompletely.
You must write within the given time.
